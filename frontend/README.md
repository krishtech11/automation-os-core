# Modular Automation Platform (Build in Public)

This repository contains the core backend and frontend skeleton of a modular automation system designed to orchestrate repetitive digital tasks using schedulers, APIs, and intelligent workflows.

The project is being built **publicly over 10 weeks**, with a focus on real-world engineering practices, not tutorials or toy demos.

---

## 🚧 Current Status (Week 1)
✅ Backend project structure initialized  
✅ Frontend base setup completed  
✅ Database connectivity configured  
✅ Initial API endpoints tested  

---

## 🎯 Core Objectives
- Task orchestration using schedulers
- Modular workflow execution
- API and system-level automation
- Scalable backend architecture
- Clean frontend monitoring dashboard

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Backend: Python (Flask)
- Frontend: React + Vite
- Database: PostgreSQL
- Version Control: Git & GitHub

---

## 📌 Development Approach
This project is being constructed iteratively with:
- Weekly engineering milestones
- Visible progress and refactors
- Real failures and performance tuning
- Production-style architecture decisions

---

## 📅 Build Timeline
Week 1 → Foundation & system skeleton ✅  
Week 2+ → Automation engines, schedulers, and integrations (in progress)
