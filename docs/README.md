# Modular Automation Platform (Core System)

This repository contains the core backend and frontend foundation of a modular automation system designed to orchestrate repetitive digital tasks using schedulers, workflows, and system/API-level integrations.

The project is being built publicly as part of a "10-week engineering challenge", focusing on real-world automation, system design, and scalable backend architecture.

## 🎯 Objective

The primary goal of this system is to:
- Accept high-level user instructions
- Translate them into structured automation workflows
- Execute those workflows across:
  - Web automation
  - File system automation
  - Cloud API integrations
  - Background job schedulers

This is not a demo project — it is being designed as a "production-grade automation engine" step by step.

## 🧩 Current Project Status (Week 1)

- ✅ Backend project structure initialized
- ✅ Database connected and core models defined
- ✅ Basic API endpoints tested
- ✅ Frontend base setup completed
- ✅ Version control and documentation initialized

Upcoming weeks will progressively introduce:
- Task schedulers
- Real automation engines
- API integrations
- AI-based intent parsing
- Distributed background workers
- Full deployment pipeline
